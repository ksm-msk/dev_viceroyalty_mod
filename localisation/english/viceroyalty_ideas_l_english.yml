  resistance_origins: "Resisting Their Occupation"
  resistance_origins_desc: "Through local guerillas, scavenging armouries and annoying the shit out of them we managed to put up some form of resistance, but it was severely weak and the enemy was strong. Many people gave up or gave their lives away, but we knew what were up against and what we were fighting for."

  obedience_origins: "Enduring Their Occupation"
  obedience_origins_desc: "When they came we knew we had no chance of fighting back, their oppression was too powerful and we were only people with one agenda, to stay alive. So we put our heads down and waited until a noticeable change occured, ... like a nuclear explosion."

  defensive_industry: "Investments in the Defense Industry"
  defensive_industry_desc: "Although we secured our independence and are free from the misery of Aztlán's weakening empire we would be lying if we said we were not afraid of the threat of retaliation from them. To combat this we decided to invest some of our caps into our defenses, more guns, more ammo and more fortifications across the Rio Lerma. It will slow them down enough for Tlaloc to come and aid us with reinforcments."

  trading_sector: "More Funding for the Market"
  trading_sector_desc: "The trading sector of our economy is the largest source of income for us, without it the nation could barely pay for much of the expediture needed to uphold our independence. So why not gain more? With a few investments here and there we accelerated the industry and became one of the richest in Mexico."
